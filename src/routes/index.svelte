<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadboard">
"A breadboard is a construction base for prototyping of electronics.
Originally the word referred to a literal bread board, a polished piece of wood used for slicing bread.
In the 1970s the solderless breadboard (a.k.a. plugboard, a terminal array board) became available and nowadays the term "breadboard" is commonly used to refer to these."

This site is a starting place to hosting Breadboard projects.

These projects are small, unorganized, and lack key sections of functionality.
